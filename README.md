# 👋 Hi, I'm Bret

I’m a software developer passionate about building reliable, well-crafted applications that make a real impact. My journey started with Go, and I’ve been hooked ever since—its simplicity and power drew me away from the chaos of other ecosystems. Over time, I’ve expanded my focus to backend development, cloud security, and automation, with an eye toward building tools that improve how teams deliver software and stay compliant.
